# hi, i’m emma! 🎧

i’m a frontend developer who’s really into clean design, smooth interactions, and building things that just feel good to use. right now i’m focused on web development, but i’ve been getting more curious about mobile app dev too.

## ˚ʚ♡ɞ˚ what i’m into:
- frontend dev (react, next.js, tailwind)
- learning mobile (react native + flutter 👀)
- ui/ux and web design
- gaming + boba = my ideal weekend
- diamond support in overwatch 2 (masters by end of year...? 😤)

always down to connect, collab, or just chat about cool ideas. ˆ𐃷ˆ
